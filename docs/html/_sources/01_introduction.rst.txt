============


Screenberry is the only professional projection mapping software available running natively on Linux.

Since the official version is missing a simple user manual with search function, I decided to write this one.
Its mostly used for myself :)



The Screenberryâ„¢ software is a powerful and intuitive tool for administering real-time multi-screen playback at extremely high resolutions. It is a perfect solution for 3D mapping, dome projection, stage screens, and multimedia installations.
