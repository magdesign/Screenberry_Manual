# Screenberry_Manual
unofficial Screenberry Manual for Linux users


Currently not available on gh-pages or on any webserver, hopefully coming soon (need to figure out how to properly render html pages with styleshetts on github).
However,
to view the manual, click on top right the green "Code" button, download as *.zip, extract it, navigate to the *"/docs/html"* folder  and open *index.html* in your webbrowser.

Contributs are very welcome.
